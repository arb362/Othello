Multiplayer Othello/Reversi that I developed originally as a Fathers Day present. It has the capabilities for multiplayer both on a local network and outside the network.
The websocket library from https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket is used to implement the multiplayer functionality and it is included in its compiled form in lib/Websocket.jar
In order to use multiplayer you will need the code from github.com/arb362/othello-server
